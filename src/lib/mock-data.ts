## Problem Description

Given an array of integers **nums** and an integer **target**, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to **target**.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Example 1:
\`\`\`
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
\`\`\`

### Example 2:
\`\`\`
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
\`\`\`

### Example 3:
\`\`\`
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
\`\`\`

### Constraints:
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
- Only one valid answer exists.

## Problem Description

You are given an array \`prices\` where \`prices[i]\` is the price of a given stock on the i-th day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

### Example 1:
\`\`\`
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
\`\`\`

### Example 2:
\`\`\`
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
